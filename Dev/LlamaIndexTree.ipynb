See the other page of this document for the list of our 10 KPIs, which we started tracking as of November 1st.\\n\\nAs you will notice, we have a lot of room for improvement, which is expected considering we didn’t have bandwidth to look into things like out of box experience or conversion funnels until now. The next step for our contractor is to take concrete actions to improve the KPIs.\\n\\nReal Launch Update\\n------------------\\n\\nWe have now reached a point where we could launch Everpix with a few days notice: the product features in Everpix 1.1 really reflect the Everpix vision and make it very clear Everpix is not another Flickr or SmugMug.\\n\\nOur current problem is fine-tuning the product messaging for launch and finding a great PR firm to launch with.
