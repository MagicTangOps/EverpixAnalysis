    "# RAPTOR: Recursive Abstractive Processing for Tree-Organized Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to use an implementation of RAPTOR with llama-index, leveraging the RAPTOR llama-pack.\n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR works by recursively clustering and summarizing clusters in layers for retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "There two retrieval modes:\n",
    "- tree_traversal -- traversing the tree of clusters, performing top-k at each level in the tree.\n",
    "- collapsed -- treat the entire tree as a giant pile of nodes, perform simple top-k.\n",
    "\n",
    "See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.18059) for full algorithm details."

      "Everpix project started in April 2011 and was officially announced at TechCrunch Disrupt in September 2011. The Private Alpha phase aimed to test the infrastructure and software, with around 5,000 users registering and 2,080 importing photos. The Mac Uploader was used by 732 users, with an average of 10,000 photos imported by Mac users. The Public Beta was launched at the end of 2011, allowing anyone to create an account. Unexpected PR coverage led to 3,000 new users and 8,000,000 new photos imported, causing infrastructure scaling issues. The back end infrastructure was re-engineered for the Public Beta using Tornado & MySQL on Amazon Web Services. Recruitment for key positions like Android and Windows developers was challenging. Financially, expenses exceeded the budget due to higher lawyer fees and hiring. Future goals include releasing Everpix 1.0, offering premium subscriptions, and addressing recruitment challenges. The co-founders plan to adjust their salaries, and a Series A funding round is targeted for the summer.\n"
